Task 3: Interview Questions & Answers

1. What does SELECT \* do?
   SELECT \* retrieves all columns from a table. It’s useful when you want to see the complete data but not ideal for large tables because it fetches unnecessary columns.

2. How do you filter rows?
   You filter rows using the WHERE clause with conditions. Examples:
   SELECT \* FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'India';
   SELECT \* FROM Products WHERE Price > 500;

3. What is LIKE '%value%'?
   LIKE is used for pattern matching. % represents zero or more characters.

* 'A%' → matches values starting with A
* '%sh%' → matches values containing 'sh' anywhere

4. What is BETWEEN used for?
   BETWEEN is used to filter values within a range (inclusive).
   Example:
   SELECT \* FROM Customers WHERE Contact BETWEEN 9000000000 AND 9999999999;

5. How do you limit output rows?
   Use LIMIT to restrict the number of rows returned.
   Example:
   SELECT \* FROM Customers LIMIT 5;

6. Difference between = and IN
   \= checks for a single value.
   IN allows checking against multiple values at once.
   Example:
   WHERE Country = 'India';
   WHERE Country IN ('India','USA');

7. How to sort in descending order?
   Use ORDER BY column DESC.
   Example:
   SELECT \* FROM Customers ORDER BY First\_Name DESC;

8. What is aliasing?
   Aliasing is renaming a column or table for readability using AS.
   Example:
   SELECT First\_Name AS Name, Last\_Name AS Surname FROM Customers;

9. Explain DISTINCT.
   DISTINCT removes duplicate values in the result set.
   Example:
   SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;

10. What is the default sort order?
    The default sort order is ascending (ASC) when using ORDER BY without specifying ASC or DESC.
